This application (called **ü¶é GAD**) was prepared and developed **only for testing purposes**. It provides:

- GUI
- REST API
- Swagger Doc

This application contains simple logic, statistics, charts, games, different resources, **deliberately prepared bugs**üêõ and various challenges.

Thanks to this configuration, we are able to **reflect real project reality**üòâ

P.S. In addition, the application has some **serious design flaws** - I wonder if you will notice them?üòâ
